# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
#
# Singular runtime image for the HeroForge-Anew PyQt6 desktop application.
#
# This image is built and launched via docker-compose.yml (or its podman
# equivalent) for QA "developer-in-the-loop" testing. The GUI is rendered on an
# X server forwarded from the host/devcontainer (see docker-compose.yml and the
# desktop-lite feature in .devcontainer/devcontainer.json).
#
# It is intentionally separate from the development container defined under
# .devcontainer/ — that one is for editing/linting/testing the code, while this
# one exists purely to *run* the application in an isolated, reproducible way.

# --- System libraries required by PyQt6 / Qt at runtime ----------------------
# Qt links against a number of shared X11 / OpenGL / XCB / font libraries even
# when it only ever talks to a forwarded X server. They are installed without
# recommended extras to keep the image lean; apt metadata is removed afterwards.
